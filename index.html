        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is America Montanez and I am currently a second year student at the University of California, Riverside. After graduation, I plan to attend law school in hopes of becoming an immigration lawyer. Growing up in the wine country in Northern California, I have witnessed countless of immigrant farm workers risk their lives everyday by going to work despite being undocumented. Despite these workers only trying to provide for their family and put food on the table, their lives can change any second. My goal is to change the lives of individuals like farm workers when challenges come their way in which I can help to the best of my ability. I want to give back to the community that has given me everything by helping essential farm workers and fight for them to live in this country. <br><br>

        I have continuously worked in my community through volunteering and contributing a lot of my free time to make a difference. I have volunteered at food banks where I assembled grocery boxes and packaged bags filled with fresh produce for families in need. Furthermore, I have volunteered at my local high school to tutor students and provide educational support for them to reach their goals. Besides volunteer work, I have also worked in the food industry in which I built great communication skills which have allowed me to succeed outside of work. I always looked for better ways of completing tasks while trying to improve the productivity and keep tables ready for incoming guests. I have always been very passionate about giving back to my community which is why in high school I had over fifty hours of volunteer work. Now as a second year college student, I have tried finding new ways of volunteering and giving back to my new community since moving several hours away from home. I am currently working front desk at a hotel and spa in which I greet people everyday and make sure they have a good experience. Through this job, I have learned the importance of patience while working with customers and the significance of being responsible in a professional setting. I have constantly been working for years at different places but nonetheless I continue to grow as an individual through my work experience as well as my volunteer work which I am extremely proud of myself for. 
        <br><br>
        Throughout my educational experience, I have remained a studious and motivated student who constantly strives for the best. I have made the honors list for four consecutive quarters while maintaining a high GPA. I am currently in a society in which I have the opportunity to raise money through philanthropy events for our philanthropic partner Girls on the Run. I have built several interpersonal skills through this organization which I constantly get the opportunity to give back. I plan to join another organization soon which I will get the chance to build on my passion for law and prepare myself for the LSAT and law school as well.
